# Phase3_Final_Project
# School Admin Database Project

The School Admin Database project is an educational management system built using SQLAlchemy for database interaction and Alembic for database migrations. It allows you to manage schools, students, workers, and teachers in a school administration context. 
This README provides an overview of the project's structure, setup instructions, and basic usage.

## Features

- **School Class:** Manage school-related information such as name, location, and contact details.
- **Student Class:** Store student details including name, age, grade, and enrollment information.
- **Workers Class:** Track information about non-teaching staff members in the school.
- **Teachers Class:** Manage information about teachers, including their subject expertise.

## Dependencies

- SQLAlchemy: A Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for interacting with the database.
- Alembic: A database migration tool for managing changes to your database schema.
- Faker: A Python library for generating fake data, which can be useful for testing and populating the database.
- Datetime: A Python module for handling date and time operations.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/school-admin-database.git
